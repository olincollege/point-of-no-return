## Libraries and Packages
Our game is built using [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/), a Python wrapper for the [Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library](https://www.libsdl.org/), which allows access to a computer's multimedia components. We also used the [PyGame-menu](https://pygame-menu.readthedocs.io/en/4.0.4/) library for main menus in the game. To install the packages needed to run this game, run the following command in Bash:

`$ pip install pygame pygame-menu`
